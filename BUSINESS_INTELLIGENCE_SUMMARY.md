## ThyOwn Framework - Local AI Capability

### Philosophy
> "If it hasn't been created yet, create it ourselves."

The ThyOwn directory contains a complete self-sufficient AI training system designed for maximum independence from external APIs.

### Current Status (Verified December 3, 2025)
| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Hardware** | RTX 5070 Ti detected, awaiting PyTorch sm_120 support (Q1-Q2 2026) |
| **Models** | Flux.1-dev (23GB) downloaded, Llama 70B planned |
| **Motion Gen** | ✅ Optical flow interpolation working |
| **Video Assembly** | ✅ FFmpeg-based composition ready |
| **Image Processing** | ✅ OpenCV transformations available |
| **Core Framework** | ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED - Tensors, Autograd, Optimizers, Transformers |
| **Training Script** | ✅ Fixed (NaN loss → proper softmax cross-entropy) |
| **SimpleGPT** | ✅ 5.2M params, forward/generate working |

### Self-Sufficient GPT Implementation
A complete from-scratch GPT implementation exists:
- **OwnTokenizer** - Custom BPE tokenizer (no tiktoken dependency)
- **SimpleGPT** - Multi-head attention transformer (YOUR code)
- **Training Loop** - AdamW optimizer, gradient computation
- **Inference** - Autoregressive generation with temperature sampling

### Scaling Path
| Phase | Parameters | Data | Goal |
|-------|------------|------|------|
| Current | 512K | 1K docs | Learning |
| Phase 2 | 5M | 10K docs | Production-quality |
| Phase 3 | 125M (GPT-2 small) | 6M Wikipedia articles | Competitive |
| Phase 4 | 1B+ | Custom domain | Expert system |

### Hybrid Strategy
While GPU support matures:
- **Local-First**: Motion, video, image processing
- **API Fallback**: DALL-E, GPT-4, OpenAI TTS (cost-controlled)
- **Full Local (Q2 2026)**: All inference on RTX 5070 Ti

- **Accessibility-first design** (WCAG 2.1 AA+)

### Target Client Profile
| Criteria | Details |
